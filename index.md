# Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a Strong Data Analytics professional (Data Architect) with a Master of Science - MS focused in Data Science from Bellevue University.  As part of the MS Program, I have specialized in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, Python R and Big Data.

I’m looking forward to applying various techniques of the power of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning  and Big Data on Predictive Reporting and Analytics / AI projects, machine learning, and applications of data science.

The higher level focus of the Master of Science in Data Science as below

  1. Preparation of datasets for solving problems.
  2. Recommendation of appropriate data modeling techniques to test hypotheses.
  3. Communication of data science results in answers for domain challenges.
  4. Identify ethical considerations in dataset preparation and modeling.

## Statistics for Data Science 

### 1. Avocado Price Prediction - R

[Github Location](https://github.com/RGunasekaran21249030/DSC520-new/tree/master/assignments/Final%20Project)

My Project intends to thoroughly exploratory data analysis of the avocado prices increase along with customer behavior. The Data comes from Kaggle which is provided by the Hass Avocado Board website compiled into a one CSV file and the data contains from 2015 to 2018 Avocado Purchases in the USA. The Project also tries to analyze the price elasticity of demand and find the comparison of conventional and organic avocados since Organic consumption is increasing in recent days.

> This project developed by using R Programming. Also I have used various statistics related to regression Linear, Multi-Linear Techniques and various visualization techniques.

### 4. US Election prediction - R

[Github location](https://github.com/RGunasekaran21249030/dsc520/blob/master/Final_Project1_GunasekaranRagunath%20(2)%20(1).docx)

Data consolidated Kaggle and Twitter API. The model used was very basic. After this semester, I have learnt about model performance and testing options. Hence this project work can be re-visited and applied to all the new features and make this prediction work very well. 

> This project developed by using R Programming.
