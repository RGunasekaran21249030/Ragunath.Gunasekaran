# Welcome to my portfolio.

I'm a Strong Data Analytics professional (Data Architect) with a Master of Science - MS focused in Data Science from Bellevue University.  As part of MS Program, I have specialized in Machine Learning, Data Mining, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, Python and Big Data.

I’m looking forward to apply various techniques of the power of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning  and Big Data on Predictive Reporting and Analytics / AI projects, machine learning, and applications of data science.

The higher level focus of the Master of Science in Data Science as below

  1. Prepararation of datasets for solving problems.
  2. Recommendatio of appropriate data modeling techniques to test hypotheses.
  3. Communicatation of data science results into answers for domain challenges.
  4. Identify ethical considerations in dataset preparation and modeling.

#### 1. Avocado Price Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis in R

[Github Location](https://github.com/RGunasekaran21249030/DSC520-new/tree/master/assignments/Final%20Project)

When I started this project, I learned that Avocado became America’s new favorite fruit and It is a “superfood”. Hass Avocado Board (HAB) helps to increase the consumption of Avocados. The study shows that Avocado Consumption per capita in the 90’s was 1.6 lbs but per capita is increased, as of 2017, Avocado Consumption per capita is 7.1 lbs.

My Project intends to thoroughly exploratory data analysis of the avocado prices increase along with customer behavior. The Data comes from Kaggle which is provided by Hass Avocado Board website compiled into a one CSV file and the data contains from 2015 to 2018 Avocado Purchases in the USA. The Project also tries to analyze the price elasticity of demand and find the comparison of conventional and organic avocados since Organic consumption is increasing in recent days.

This project developed by using R Programming. Also I have used various stastics related regression Linear, Multi-Linear Techniques and various visulization techniques.
